Command-line tool to permit the easy usage of multiple GitHub deploy keys simultaneously. 

## Credits

The idea for this tool (and some of the trickier Git / SSH implementation details) is taken from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/vhermecz/4e2ae9468f2ff7532bf3f8155ac95c74), for which the license can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/vhermecz/67b6e3491a8de566bf6d8577b9d431f1).
